# Data-Analytics-101

This repository contains a Data Analytics Masterclass that I designed for [AllWomen](https://www.allwomen.tech) on October 7th 2021.

The masterclass focused on:

1. The Data Scientific Method
2. Loading and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Answering questions using Data Visualization
4. Conclusions & Resources for the beginners

You can check the recording on of the lab in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlHrcvEo2Vo&t=302s&ab_channel=allWomen)! We had a lot of fun :)
